                New York in the 1980's
            </h1>
            <p>
                New York in the 1980's is not the same New York City we see before our very eyes today. Back then, New York was unsafe with record high homicide rates and drugs at every corner. New York was heroine infested, overrun with prostitution and graffiti-ridden prior to the street art movement. Forty years later, NYC has become a gentrified urban playground and home of the rich. It was a far call from the city-life we know and love today.
            </p>
            <p>
                The streets were dirty. The sidewalks grimmy. The city was constantly under construction and each corner was scaffoleded. The city was wild. This was all due to finanical crisis that occured in 1975. Rent was low, everyone was in everyone's business, and life was just different. One the other hand, New York was not all bad. Prior to the existence of smart phones, people were more accessible and the entertainment business was bustling. Theaters, nightclubs, cinemas, and the music scene were all the rage.

                East Village in 1980's
            </h1>
            <p>
                Despite all that was going on in the 1980's in New York, there was a turning point in a little neighborhood called the East Village. The East Village is located in the east side of Lower Manhattan. It's west point is Bowery street, while its eastern parameter is the East River. It's upper north point is 12th street, and end at East Houston. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The East Village is the first foreign language neighborhood in the USA, and its earlier inhabitants were Ukranian and Polish immigrants and the remains of the earlier still remain in the Neighborhood today, like Veselka which is a Ukranian restaurant and Polish delis. The neighborhood is made up of 19th and 20th century low-slung buildings with gentrified high-rises on every Avenue.
            </p>
            <p>
                The population is roughly 72, 000 and 40% of that population is made up of people between the ages of 20 and 34 (US Census). While the East Village still homes its early immigrant groups, during the mid 1900s the gradual migration of the Beatniks movement brought artists, musicians, students and hippies.

                        1980's Culture in the East Village
                    </h1>
            <p> 
               In the 1950's the Beatniks began to make their way to the East Village on their search for cheap rent. Following that, the East Village became the heart of the underground culture in NYC and is considered the birthplace of punk-rock, hip-hop, anti-folk and many other musical genres. Artists like Madonna, Blondie, Velvet Underground and Pink Floyd started their careers there during the 1970s and 1980s. It became a rite of passage for those with a creative inclination. The neighborhood no longer became a destination for European immigrants and the poor working-class. It became an area became an institution for the creative class.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this brief blip in time, the bohemian life still inhabits the East Village despite the rent prices skyrocketing. Much like most of NYC in the 1980's, the East Village was grimmy, overrun by cocaine and heroine. Nonetheless, the nightclub and music scene were booming which is why artists and musicians alike fled to the area. It is a cultural hotspot and became the Mecca for Punk-Rock with hipsters adorned with leather jackets and Doc Martens.

            <p>
             Eventhough the area has cleaned up its act a little since then, the East Village still has a edgy feel to it. Nightclubs and bars scattered across every street in the midst of sleek high-rise apartment buildings. Punk-Rock themed stores like, Maud and Mabel still embellish the side streets and stretched avenues of the neighborhood. Today, the village is a mismatch of gentrification with a Shake Shack parallel to the infamous St.Marks Place and NYU dorms scattered through the district. Yet, the essence of the 1980's East Village still lives on.
