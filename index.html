                    Essence of the East Village
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I decided to focus this assignment on the essence of the East Village. Prior to this assignment, I had strolled into the East Village every now and then. Typically, because I had somewhere to be in the Village. After doing some thorough research on the neighborhood, I learned how culturally rich and vibrant the East Village actually is.

                    The New York Times desricbes the area as the "home of the punks and poets." German, Ukranian, and Polish immigrants once inhabited the East Village and there remains traces of their settling, from restaurants to speciality shops. By the 1970's and 80's the East Village had built a new reputation of for itself, the birthplace of Punk-Rock and home of the loavable misfits.

                    In the 1980's, the East Village was and still is known for its creative counterculture. It was home to the "New Wave" movement. It's days in the 80's caught a moment of visionary art and experimental rebellion. Today, it capture a different essence. An essence of newness and gentrification that has ultimately changed the spirit of the village.

                        The Project
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        This project was assigned in early Feburaury. We were given free reign to study any neighborhood, but we had to take into consideration that our neighborhood of choice should not be too far from where we reside. This was simply due to the fact that it would be easier to take pictures of a nearby neighborhood than something that was completely out of our way. Originally, I had wanted to study the South Village which borders with SoHo. However, the South Village is a very small neighborhood that didn't have much to offer. Hence, I chose the East Village well-knowing that I frequently visit the area.

                        I spent several days in the East Village just walking around trying to figure out what I was interested in. My inital idea was to cover the Ukranian history of the neigjborhood, but that proved to be a big task when the war between Russia and the Ukraine arose. Following this, I began to do research into the area to see what prominent eras took course over the last few decades. I landed on the idea of Punk-Rock in the 1980's. In my images I tried to capture the essence of the East Village in the 1980's. This was thrilling as I began to learn a lot about the history of Punk and how the East Village became home to many of the artists we love today, like Madonna and The Ramones.
